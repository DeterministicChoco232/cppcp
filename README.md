#  Competitive Programming C++

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems from Codeforces, as well as other items which I use for my environment.


## Directories
Completed stores all the solutions I have done with the names such as "4a.cpp" for the solution to the problem 4A on codeforces.    
Othercompleted stores other solutions to problems outside of codeforces.  
Failedapproaches stores interesting approaches I tried but either gave up on or they do not work.  



## Bash files

Presently there are 5 bash files I wrote (with a bit of help from ChatGPT of course):  
ed - creates and edits contest files using neovim.  
sb - submits solutions using the cf client.  
db - debugs files using gdb.  
dsp - displays the problem statement as well as initializes input/output files using python with BeautifulSoup4.  
tst - uses the input/output files to test with the sample test cases.
