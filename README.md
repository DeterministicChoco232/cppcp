#  Competitive Programming C++

This repository contains my solutions to various competitive programming problems from Codeforces, as well as other items which I use for my environment.


## Directories
Completed stores all the solutions I have done with the names such as "4a.cpp" for the solution to the problem 4A on codeforces.
Othercompleted stores other solutions to problems outside of codeforces.



## Bash files

Presently there are 5 bash files I wrote (with a bit of help from ChatGPT of course):
ed - creates and edits contest files using neovim.
sb - submits solutions using the cf client.
db - debugs files using gdb.
dsp - displays the problem statement as well as initializes input/output files.
tst - uses the input/output files to test with the sample test cases.
